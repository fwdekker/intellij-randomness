/**
 * A state holds variables that can be configured, validated, copied, and loaded.
 *
 * In a [State], fields are typically mutable, because the user can change the field. However, fields that themselves
 * also contain data (e.g. a [Collection] or a [DecoratorScheme]) should be stored as immutable references (but may
 * themselves be mutable). For example, instead of having the field `var list: List<String>`, a [State] should have the
 * field `val list: MutableList<String>`. This reflects the typical case in which the user does not change the reference
 * to the object, but changes the properties inside the object. And, more importantly, means that nested a
 * [SchemeEditor] can share a single unchanging reference to a [State] with its nested [SchemeEditor]s.
 *
 * Properties should be annotated with [Transient] (not [kotlin.jvm.Transient]) to ensure they are not stored. The
 * specifics of how the annotation is applied and inherited are complicated. The following rules apply:
 * - Immutable non-[Collection]s (e.g. `val foo: Int` or `val bar: State`) are not serialized. These properties should
 *   not be annotated, not even "just in case" nor "for clarity".
 * - Immutable [Collection]s (e.g. `val foo: List<Int>` or `val bar: List<State>`) are not serialized, unless annotated
 *   with a serialization annotation such as [com.intellij.util.xmlb.annotations.XCollection] or
 *   [com.intellij.util.xmlb.annotations.OptionTag].
 * - Mutable properties (i.e. `var`) are serialized, unless annotated with [Transient].
 * - Do not combine [Transient] with any other serialization annotations.
 * - To annotate a mutable property (i.e. `var`), use `@get:Transient`.
 * - To annotate a lateinit property (i.e. `lateinit var`), use both `@field:Transient` and `@get:Transient`.
 * - When a property overrides a property from a superclass, only the annotations in the subclass are relevant.
 * - Since `abstract` properties must always be overridden, they should be annotated only in the subclass. Adding
 *   additional annotations "for clarity" in a superclass should be avoided, since it is completely useless and
 *   therefore misleading.
 * - Since `open` properties are not always overridden, if they are annotated, they should be annotated in both the
 *   superclass and the subclass.
 * - See also `isSerialized` in `StateReflection` in Randomness' test module.
 *
 * These observations are based on IntelliJ Community 2024.1. See also the bug report at
 * [IJPL-175868](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IJPL-175868/).
